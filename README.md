tic tac toe in C

The program tictactoe.c is a game of tic tac toe for 2 players. Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O". When the program runs, it'll ask for player 1 to move. You move by entering two numbers, the first number is the row of the board and the second one is the column of the board. For example, if I wanted to move in the top left corner, I would input "0 0". It keeps running until someone gets 3 in a row or until there are no more spaces on the board.
